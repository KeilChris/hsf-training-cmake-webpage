Before working through the tutorial, please be diligent and read through this page and ensure you
are familiar with all of these computing skills.  They are essential for any HEP physicist
and will benefit you throughout your career.  However, if you are pressed for time in the next days
then **be sure to install and familiarize yourself with Docker**.


## Install This Now!: [Docker][]

[Docker][] is a powerful tool that allows you
to perform a virtualisation of your environment but completely in software.  It
allows you to bundle up the installation of tools for use by others in a uniform way
and we will be using it throughout this bootcamp.  Installing docker is absolutely
necessary and there are directions to do this in each operating system.  For those
of you that are using a Windows operating system, if you already have docker running
and are comfortable using it, that is fine.  However, if you do not, then be aware
that its usage on Windows can be challenging and none of the tutors know how to use
such a setup.  Therefore, *we highly recommend that you reconsider
your decision to use the Windows operating system as a high energy physicist.*


Useful docker containers:

* `atlas/analysisbase:21.2.75`: See the [ATLAS-Docker preworkshop setup](https://adjackp.github.io/pre-workshopMaterial/02-atlasdocker/index.html).
